# P5-1_Neighborhood_map
This is the application for Udacity Nanodegree (FE) project 5-1

## Information for Users

### Description

Application shows to a user a number of cities, which, I believe, are interesting to visit. User can see those cities on the Google Map. User also can view a number of details about each city, including data from Wikipedia and Flickr
